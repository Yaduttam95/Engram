## What is Engram?

Traditional note-taking apps are static digital cabinets—you throw information in and hope to find it later.

**Engram is different.** It is your active thinking partner.

It uses local AI (Llama 3.1) to **read, understand, and organize** your thoughts in real-time. You simply dump your brain; Engram handles the filing, connects ideas, and lets you "chat" with your own knowledge base.

It is built for developers, thinkers, and anyone who wants to build a massive personal library without the manual labor.

### Why you'll love it:

- 🧠 **Auto-Categorization**:  Type "Fix the API bug on auth service," and it automatically files it under `Work/Engineering` and tags it `#bug` `#backend`. Zero manual effort required.
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Forget keywords. Ask "What did I decide about the database migration last week?" and it retrieves the exact context, even if you phrased it differently.
- 🔒 **100% Local**: No cloud. No subscription APIs. Your data remains securely on your local machine.

## 🚀 Get Started

Getting up and running is effortless. 

1. **Install Prerequisites**: You need Python, Node, and Ollama. (See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for details).
2. **Run One Command**:

```bash
./engram run
```

That's it. It starts the backend, the frontend, and opens your browser.
