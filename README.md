## What is Engram?

Most note-taking apps are just digital cabinets—you throw stuff in, and hope you find it later.

**Engram is different.** It's a thinking partner.

It uses local AI (Llama 3.1) to **read, understand, and organize** your thoughts as you type them. You just dump your brain; Engram handles the filing. It connects ideas, finds relationships, and lets you "chat" with your own knowledge base.

It’s built for developers, thinkers, and anyone who wants to build a massive personal library without the manual labor.

### Why you'll love it:

- 🧠 **Auto-Categorziation**:  Type "Fix the API bug on auth service," and it automatically files it under `Work/Engineering` and tags it `#bug` `#backend`. You don't do a thing.
- 🔍 **Semantic Search**: Forget keywords. Ask "What did I decide about the database migration last week?" and it finds the answer, even if you never used those exact words.
- 🔒 **100% Local**: No cloud. No subscription APIs. Your data hits your local disk and stays there.

## 🚀 Get Started

We've made it incredibly simple to start. 

1. **Install Prerequisites**: You need Python, Node, and Ollama. (See [SETUP.md](./SETUP.md) for details).
2. **Run One Command**:

```bash
./engram run
```

That's it. It starts the backend, the frontend, and opens your browser.
